- 👋 Hi, I’m @helcret
- 👀 Though I am a software engineer, I use github to track my in-progress novel 'dead_blossoms'🥀
- 🌱 I code in Java and TS but my all time favourite is still C++
- 💞️ I am open to collaborate or join groups meant for budding writers 📝  
- 📫 If you are intersted in my work (though as of today all my repos are private) reach me at yogeshkumar7689@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I send people instagram reels based on their humour and doctor them to uplift it. (better than meta algo😉)
